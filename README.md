This is my comptia security+ Capstone Project, trying to applying good security practices to my own daily life 



FOSS
https://alternativeto.net/
WPA2 (minimum)
Spoof macaddress


### Sensitive information ####

- Cookies 
- Public IP address 
- Metadata (pictures and analytics)



Use a password manager (Bitwarden)
~ will inevitably move to hardware authentication devices (YubiKey) to avoid pottential databreaches
~ I use bitwarden for the convenience of cloud storage but, 
~ Cloud base password manager "bitwarden"

Password Generator 
64bits - 70bits+ of enthropy is preferable 

I don't like passphrasses like "margaretthatcheris110%SEXY" is they are prone to dictionary attacks

## Digital footprint ###
- avoid reusing passwords since if a data breach happens, all your accounts are susceptible to being a victim to a bad-actor

To clear digital Footprint 
1. Find Unused services 
2. Input fake personal information to modify their databases (gorilla mail)
3. delete the accounts


### How to find unused services ###
- if you used google password manager
- old confirmation emails
